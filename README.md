# Apnea ECG Test Dataset Annotations

This is pretty self explanatory. I went through the process of changing a text archive file
into proper apn files for future people so they don't have to be hassled by this. I am
going to communicate with physionet so that they can include my files in their proper dataset.
Hopefully this repo will not be necessary for long.
